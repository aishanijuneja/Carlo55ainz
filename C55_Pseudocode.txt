Pseudocode for Encryption Process:

Derive Key:
Use scrypt with passphrase and salt to derive a 16-byte key.

Initialize Cipher:
Initialize AES cipher in CBC mode with the derived key and IV.

Pad Message:
Pad the message to be a multiple of 16 bytes using PKCS#7.

Encrypt:
Encrypt the padded message using the cipher.


Your Objective:
Use the provided details to decrypt the message and find the flag. Good luc
